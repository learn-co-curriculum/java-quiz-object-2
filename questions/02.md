# Non-Access Modifiers

```java
public class Question {
    private String prompt;
    private String answer;
    private static int numRetries = 3;
    private static final int TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS = 60;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Question q1 = new Question();
        Question q2 = new Question();
        Question q3 = new Question();
        ....
    }
}
```

The three `Question` objects will each store their own copy of the `prompt` variable in memory.

## Correct

True

## Incorrect

False

> Incorrect.  The `prompt` field is an instance variable because it does not have the `static` modifier.
> Each `Question` object stores its own copy of the `prompt` instance variable in the heap.
