# Non-Access Modifiers

```java
public class Question {
    private String prompt;
    private String answer;
    private static int numRetries = 3;
    public static final int TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS = 60;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Question q1 = new Question();
        Question q2 = new Question();
        Question q3 = new Question();
        ....
    }
}
```

The three `Question` objects created in the `main` method will each store their own copy of the `numRetries` variable in memory.

## Incorrect

True

> Incorrect.  The `static` modifier means the field `numRetries` is a class variable,
> so there is only one copy of the variable stored in memory.
