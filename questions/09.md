# Memory Management and Garbage Collection

```java
public class Product {
  String name;
  double price;

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Product prod1 = new Product();
    Product prod2 = new Product();

    Product saleProduct = prod1;

    prod1.name = "chips";
    prod1.price = 3.25;

    prod2.name = "pretzels";
    prod2.price = 3.75;

    saleProduct.price = 2.95;
    saleProduct = prod2;
    saleProduct.name = "bargain-" + saleProduct.name;

  }
}
```

What value is stored in each field after the last line of code executes?

Carefully consider which object `saleProduct` points at each time a field
is assigned a value.

prod1.name [answer1]  
prod1.price [answer2]

prod2.name [answer3]  
prod2.price [answer4]
