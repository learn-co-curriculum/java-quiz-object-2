# Memory Management and Garbage Collection

```java
public class Product {
  String name;
  double price;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      
    Product prod1 = new Product();
    Product prod2 = new Product();

    Product saleProduct = prod1;

    prod1.name = "chips";
    prod1.price = 3.25;

    prod2.name = "pretzels";
    prod2.price = 3.75;

    saleProduct.price = 2.95;
   
  }
}
```

What value is stored in each field after the last line of code executes?
It might help to draw the objects and pointers on paper to keep track of the object state.

prod1.name [answer1]  
prod1.price [answer2]

prod2.name [answer3]  
prod2.price [answer4]

saleProduct.name [answer5]  
saleProduct.price [answer6]
