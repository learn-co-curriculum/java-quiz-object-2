# Memory Management and Garbage Collection

```java
public class Product {
  String name;
  double price;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Product prod1 = new Product();
    Product prod2 = new Product();
    Product saleProduct = prod1;

    prod1.name = "Potato Chips";
    prod1.price = 3.00;

    prod2.name = "Pretzels";
    prod2.price = 2.75;

    saleProduct.price -= 1.00;

    System.out.println(prod2.name + " $" + prod2.price);

  }
}
```

What is printed when the `main` method executes?

## Correct
Pretzels $2.75

> Correct! The variable `saleProduct` is not assigned to `prod2`, so the price remains 2.75.
