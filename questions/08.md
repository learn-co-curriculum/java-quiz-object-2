# Memory Management and Garbage Collection

```java
public class Product {
  String name;
  double price;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Product prod1 = new Product();
    Product prod2 = new Product();

    prod1.name = "chips";
    prod1.price = 3.25;

    prod2.name = "pretzels";
    prod2.price = 3.75;

    Product saleProduct = prod2;
    saleProduct.name = "bargain-" + saleProduct.name;

  }
}
```
