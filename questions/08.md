# Memory Management and Garbage Collection

```java
public class Product {
  String name;
  double price;

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Product prod1 = new Product();
    Product prod2 = new Product();

    Product saleProduct = prod1;

    prod1.name = "chips";
    prod1.price = 3.25;

    prod2.name = "pretzels";
    prod2.price = 3.75;

    saleProduct.name = "bargain-" + saleProduct.name;

  }
}
```

What value is stored in each field after the last line of code executes?


prod1.name [answer1]

prod1.price [answer2]

prod2.name [answer3]

prod2.price [answer4]

saleProduct.name [answer5]

saleProduct.price [answer6]

(HINT: try drawing the objects on paper to keep track of the state)
